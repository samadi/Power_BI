# Power_BI
In today's world, we are surrounded by a lot of information. It can be overwhelming to try to understand it all. That's where tools like Power BI come in. They help us see and understand this information better by turning it into pictures and graphs. In this essay, I will talk about how I used Power BI to make a dashboard. This dashboard will help us see important things about countries, like how much money they make (GDP), how many people can use electricity, and how long people usually live (life expectancy)
